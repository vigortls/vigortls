[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vigortls/vigortls.png)](http://travis-ci.org/vigortls/vigortls)

Goal
====

The goal of the VigorTLS Project is to improve the original OpenSSL codebase
by using modern C features, removing support for ancient operating systems
that are rarely used/hard to support, replacing potentially dangerous
functions/calls with secure ones, and replacing the unreadable coding style.

Currently tested operating systems
==================================

* Windows: x86
* Linux: x86, x86_64, armv6
* Mac OS X: x86_64
* FreeBSD: x86_64
