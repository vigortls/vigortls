VigorTLS
========

VigorTLS is a fork of OpenSSL developed by Kurt Cancemi.

Goal
====

The goal of the VigorTLS Project is to improve the original OpenSSL codebase
by using modern C features, removing support for ancient operating systems
that are rarely used/hard to support, replacing potentially dangerous
functions/calls with secure ones, and replacing the unreadable coding style.

2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

Currently tested operating systems
